# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques in Python. The spread of fake news can lead to significant societal issues, including misinformation, social conflicts, and the erosion of trust. Our goal is to create a model that can classify news articles as either 'real' or 'fake' to help mitigate these problems.
